                            OF MT. LEBANON, N. Y. No. 17.</head><p TEIform="p">BELIEVERS BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE. A petition was presented to the Legislature about the
                            beginning of the present century by a class who had seceded from the Society. They
                            complained that while they were living in the Community they could not see their relatives.
                            A committee was chosen to investigate the case, and they reported that if any one was
                            aggrieved they could present their complaint: but there was no farther action. On the Kith
                            of August 1813 and the loth of Aug. 1814 several of the Brethren were drafted in the war
                            service. A Declaration was drawn up and presented to the Legislature, which gave a fair
                            statement of our objections to the bill. As the Brethren had been repeatedly annoyed by the
                            military officers of the town, a memorial was drawn up in 1816 and laid before the Senate.
                            This was the first address ever sent by the Believers to the State Legislature. After a long
                            and tedious attendance upon the Legislature, an act was passed for the relief of the
                            Shakers, dated, March 29, 1816, which partially exempted them from military duty. An attempt
                            was made at a later date to repeal the law of 1816 and to pass one which would require every
                            able-bodied Shaker, between the ages of 18 and 45 years, to pay four dollars a year, as a
                            substitute for military purposes. On the 21st of Apr. 1818 the law was passed and we decided
                            to pay the unjust fines, for the sake of maintaining peace with the state. On June 4, 1820,
                            a law was passed exempting the Believers in the State of New York from all military duties.
                            In 1823 an additional law was passed, that those who were conscientiously scrupulous about
                            doing military duty, should be exempt by paying four dollars a year. On the 8th of January
                            1824, twelve Brethren were taken from the Society at Watervliet and put in the jail at
                            Albany, bat were liberated the next day. A memorial was presented to the Legislature by the
                            Brethren on which the Committee made a favorable report, but it was not approved and lost. A
                            memorial was then presented to<pb n="242" id="p4" TEIform="pb"/> Congress. It was read before the House
                            but not acted on. The Brethren having been so cruelly harassed and their property taken for
                            fines, the Society drew up another petition to present to the Legislature. This was reported
                            favorably by the Committee, but being rejected by the House, it failed to produce the
                            desired effect. In 1830 a motion was made to bring in a bill, that would abridge our rights
                            and it was concluded to address a remonstrance to the Legislature. An article entitled, "A
                            Stepping Stone" was published and.also a pamphlet entitled, "A Brief Exposition," and these
                            were laid before the House. But before the matter was fully investigated, our opponents gave
                            it up and concluded to do no more about it, and the1 storm blew over. In 1838, a memorial
                            was signed by the Brethren and Sisters to present to the Legislature to . obtain an act,
                            authorizing the Trustees to hold property in trust, and at the same time our enemies
                            presented a remonstrance against our memorial. The Committee reported favorably, but the
                            bill was not acted on as the session closed soon after. In 1839 an effort was made to obtain
                            an act confirming our deeds of Trust, and enabling us to hold deeds of real estate in
                            future, as it was feared that the Revised Statutes which had been published had invalidated
                            our right in this respect; as it was found tha-t some who left the Society, had taken
                            advantage of this supposed deficiency in our trust Deeds. We learned that they had
                            congratulated each other on the present good opportunity to seize upon the consecrated
                            property and thus dissolve the Society. April 16, 1839. The bill confirming the right of
                            Trusteeship has now become a law. This act restricted the annual income of our property to
                            five thousand dollars. In 1848 an effort was made by our enemies in the Legislature to get
                            the Trust act repealed, but they were not successful. In 1850 the Senate passed an
                            inconsistent resolve requiring an exact account of all the real and personal property of
                            every branch of our Community in the State of Xew York. In 1852 the Legislature was more
                            exacting, and the people even in our own town presented a petition against us. The Believers
                            presented a remonstrance signed by one hundred and fifty persons and a paper was signed by
                            many of the citizens of Hudson in our behalf. The Legislature, instead of granting the
                            petition that was against us, extended our charter to tweuty-iive thousand dollars instead
                            of five thousand dollars, although the favor was unsolicited. This is the last case we have
                            had in the Legislature to this date, 1858. [This closes the series of articles having
                            reference to the history of Mount Lebanon. That it has been a subject of deep interest to
                            many of our readers, we are quite well assured. Ed.]</p></div2><div2 type="poem" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="On principle we'll stand..." TEIform="index"/>On principle we'll stand...

                            principles of the gospel, that they may have a right understanding and grow up and be strong
                            both in the knowledge and practice of the truth which redeems and purifies from error, and
                            from all cause of inharmony and disquietude. Perhaps all honest people admit that it is
                            proper to confess sins to the person wronged, by the one doing them�because this restores
                            confidence and sympathetic relations which the wrong-doing had destroyed. Moreover this
                            confession is a sort of pledge supported by sympathy, that the wrong will not be repeated.
                            In this way confession is proved to be remedial, and an aid in overcoming the disposition to
                            commit offenses. But what of our secret sins, known only to ourselves and the
                            All-s&amp;eing Eye, but supposed to be covered from mortal gaze. They are not hid from
                            spirit eyes. And though we may have forgotten them, not until they are taken away by the
                            means God has appointed can we be healed of their effect. They remain in us and deteriorate
                            our spiritual and social qualities, just as a concealed ulcer in the body deteriorates our
                            physical health, and renders us liable to communicate disease to others. Moreover, concealed
                            maladies are liable at any time to break out into something more serious. Evil deeds are
                            works of darkness, and as like attracts like, while they remain concealed within, they
                            attract spirits of darkness who thus find a cover under which to work and parry the light,
                            or obstruct the vision, and even persuade to more evil deeds. Good and evil, light and
                            darkness cannot combine, healthfulty and harmoniously, nor will they abide each other's
                            presence without alternating in the government of the creature. If evil rules in permanence,
                            good will depart. If good rules in permanence, it will use the means in the gospel provided,
                            to utterly root out the evil, and burn all the tares, by honest confession, repentance, and
                            daily cross bearing. The good never fears complete and thorough exposure to the light, which
                            is of its own nature, and is a helper. It is the evil disposition which committed the act,
                            that dreads exposure, and is wounded and weakened and finally slain by honest confession and
                            walking ever in the light. For light is ever contrary to evil works, and will subdue all
                            opposition in the final issue. Mt. Lebanon, N. Y.</p></div2><div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Correspondence" TEIform="index"/>Correspondence.</head><div3 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Dear Elder, F.

                                the idea of going to Mt. Lebanon, by any means. I long to be there : I crave the
                                spiritual food that can be obtained there only. Nay, Elder, please do not think that I
                                love the world : I am sick of it. I have a partially invalid brother residing here, to
                                whom, my mother at her death, requested me ever to be a friend; he it<pb n="244" id="p6" TEIform="pb"/> is that begs me not to leave him: my heart bleeds at the thought of leaving him. And
                                may not the spirit of my mother hinder me ? Was it her that made me sick when I purposed
                                leaving here for Lebanon ? You can now see the difficult situation that I am placed in.
                                It keeps me in constant distress, not knowing what to do and do right. I have prayed
                                often for spiritual guidance in this matter, that I may do what is pleasing to God: and
                                any light or guidance that you may give me will be thankfully received. I somehow feel
                                that there will be a wray opened before long, that I may go to Lebanon. Yours in love

                                him that sent me." "Whose-soever sins ye remit, they are remitted." "The Son of Man hath
                                power on earth to remit sin." In the Second Appearing, the same order obtains. When you
                                say, that "you have prayed for spiritual guidance," you ignore the order of Christ's
                                Second Appearing, just as any anti-christian would do: they go to God direct; and you do
                                the same. You have no faith in the Elders as being able to furnish you with "spiritual
                                guidance." "They that are after the flesh, do mind the things of the flesh." Those in
                                the world, do mind the things of the world ; the natural man sees, feels, and reasons
                                like a natural man. That is just what you are doing, and is just what you did when you
                                were here; and it is just what you will do if you come back ; unless you receive more
                                faith than you now show. One of our Brethren received a letter last night from the West,
                                saying that his brother was likely to die, and wanting him to come there immediately ;
                                the letter was written by his brother's wife. The brother answered that he should not
                                come. That was faith. Your brother wanted nothing of you as a Shaker ; but he wants, as
                                a natural man, of a natural man. And if your natural affection is stronger than your
                                spiritual affection, and you love father, or mother, or brother or sister more than you
                                love Christ in your Elders, then you have no Elders; but are joined to your idols ; and
                                we can "let you alone." When Jesus said to his mother, "Woman, what have I to do with
                                thee?"�was it as a natural man? Your brother is a natural man ; he has brothers who are
                                natural men; let them care for him : what have you, as a Believer, to do with any of
                                them? You are sacrificing your spiritual relation for your natural; and your mother, as
                                a natural woman, inspires you. And when some of your natural, fleshly relations receive
                                faith that lifts them up, by a resurrection power,<pb n="245" id="p7" TEIform="pb"/> above the
                                natural order; perhaps you will be ministered unto by them; and they will be your
                                Elders. Another will take your crown�your bishopric. You count yourself unworthy of
                                eternal life, because of the faith and the cross and the sacrifice and the suffering
                                that it necessarily involves. When Agag came in before Samuel, walking delicately like a
                                king, Samuel ordered him to be hewn in pieces. Agag typified the natural man ; Samuel
                                the spiritual man. "'Can you drink of the cup that I drink of, and be baptized with the

                                Sept. No. of the Manifesto 1890. I think it a very important subject and well handled. I
                                write to show my appreciation of it and to thank her for writing it. I think if we all
                                would take especial pains to put in practice her suggestions it would make us all
                                happier, would help lift the burdens and improve the health. I have thought much on this
                                subject and wondered that it is esteemed so lightly by some. We cannot overestimate the
                                value and importance of cultivating this spirit of courtesy and kiudness and
                                consideration one to another. I think it would be a stimulus with many who come in with
                                us to remain. "The Lord is full of pity and merciful." James v., 11. See also 1 Peter
                                III., -8. Hos. xi. ,4. "Draw them with bands of love." Mic. vi., 8. "To do justly, and
                                to love mercy." We are often, very often exhorted by writers of the Holy Scriptures, and
                                also well-bred, good principled and real Christian people to a fellow feeling for others
                                ; and those who possess the most of it can do others the most good. "By love serve one
                                another." Gal. v., 10. See Job vi., 14. "To him that is afflicted pity should be shown
                                from his friend." xvi., 4. "I also could speak as ye do : if your soul were in my soul's
                                stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you." "But I would
                                strengthen you with my mouth and the moving of my lips should assuage your grief."
                                "Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them ; and them which suffer adversity."
                                Heb. xiii., 3. Civility comes from the heart, and this being right, all will work
                                together for good, peace, love, harmony, heaven. Good nature and intelligence suggests
                                politeness. That which operates most against good manners is an insensibility to or want
                                of regard for the happiness of others, and is not this an evil heart? "Be of the same
                                mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be
                                not wise in your own conceits." Rom. xii., 16., also Prov, xi., 17. "The merciful man
                                doeth good to his own soul; but he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh," Knowing how
                                much a pleasing method may do to comfort and reconcile, I do not think I could impeach
                                my worst foe if he treated me with consideration and courtesy. James ii., 13. "For he
                                shall have judgment without mercy, that showed no mercy ; and mercy rejoiceth against
                                judgment." If all our study was to so conduct as to solace others<pb n="246" id="p8" TEIform="pb"/>
                                nod voluntarily and constantly make the sacrifice needful to insure it we would need
                                little or no disciplining in behavior more than a little trial. We would soon find out
                                how this deed or that wounded or caused distress to our companion and while there was
                                nothing wrong in the act would for the sake of our associate shun it in future. Eph.
                                iv., 32. "Be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God
                                for Christ's sake hath forgiven you." How sweet to feel the holy influences of the
                                spirit of love and forgiveness. It is balm to the wounded soul which nothing else is
                                equal to ; and we may all dwell in love if we will keep our souls pure and clean, and be
                                humble looking to God for it we shall be filled to overflowing. The Manifesto is very
                                interesting and profitable. I love and appreciate it very much. Your article on ''Gentle
                                Manuers" in the April No. is excellent, also your Editorials. Your quotation from Lytton
                                is true and beautiful. "What a rare gift Is manners ! better for one to possess them
                                than wealth beauty or talents ; they will more than supply all." I love Alother Hannah
                                Kendall's exhortation "to be kind to each other and be very careful not to hurt the oil
                                and the wine. We should reverence God in each other and respect our Brothers and Sisters
                                and treat them with good manners. When we speak of our- Brethren and Sisters we should
                                call them Brethren and Sisters. We should leave all profane language, all jesting and
                                speaking unkindly of each other to the children of the world. Our words should be
                                seasoned with grace, that we do not say that which is wrong." Elder Win. Leonard's

                                to England and Scotland, may be somewhat interesting to Believers, in general. It was
                                quite a surprise to Elder John to see me on board the ship Servia, as he had not learned
                                of my anticipated journey to England. We were fortunate in obtaining one room, and in
                                eujoying the company of each other. We had a pleasant, smooth passage over, and both
                                Elder John and myself vverj kept busy answering enquiries about our faith and order of
                                religious life. We made the acquaintance of the President of the Tennessee Immigration
                                aL d Laud Co.�C. D. Sherwood. Upon our arrival in Liverpool after a voyage of eight
                                days, Elder John went to tluddersfield while 1 passed on to Manchester. I remaiued here
                                about one week and then went on to Scotland with Elder John. While in Manchester I
                                visited the Vegetarian Society whose headquarters are at 75 Princess street, and was
                                kindly invited to take tea with the Society which I at once accepted, as I knew I should
                                meet with a superior class of men and women.<pb n="247" id="p9" TEIform="pb"/> The meeting was of a
                                very interesting character, if I am to judge from what was said upon the occasion. By
                                invitation, I spoke of the history and experience of our religious order, and its
                                progress in self-deniai, and also in the proper selection of food and drinks ; of the
                                conditions most conducive to the development of a regenerative life, and the power to
                                bear a full cross against every worldly lust. The Rev. James Clark, who preaches before
                                the first vegetarian church on the earth, was present. His home is in Salforl,
                                Manchester, England. He is also president of the society, which is evidently the only
                                one left of the Concordium of which I was a member. Our object was to introduce the Law
                                dispensation on earth, as prompted by the writings of J. P. Greaves. At Kingston I had
                                the pleasure of seeing the widow of William Oldham who was second on the list of members
                                in the present Vegetarian society in England. This society has produced a marked effect
                                in London and has established no less than thirty-six vegetarian Restaurants in this
                                city. I dined in some of them and found them well patronized. From Manchester I went to
                                Leeds where I met Elder John. We next visit Scotland. We make a short stop at Penrith to
                                visit some friends. I had a most interesting time at the hotel while in conversation
                                with some of the boarders, and have reason to believe that some of the good seed of
                                gospel truth was sown in willing hearts. On the day that we reached Edinburgh we visited
                                the exhibition and saw many things of practical utility. On Saturday I went to
                                Dunfermline, the home of my birth. I called at the Press Paper office, but unfortunately
                                did not meet the editor. I next visited our very kind friend George L. an uncle of
                                Andrew Carnegie, the great iron master of Pittsburg, Pa., in the United States. He
                                accompanied us to the Library, the generous gift of friend Carnegie. I next visit the
                                old Abbey, where 1 view the resting place of all that was mortal of King Robert Bruce,
                                the liberator of Scotland. I dine with our good friend George and family, and then enjoy
                                an interesting and profitable conversation on matters pertaining to a religious life.
                                To-day, the Sabbath, I made a journey of about six miles. It was a long walk, but not
                                wearisome. I attended church, after which I renewed my acquaintance with former friends.
                                Here I may mention that I crossed the bridge Forth, a structure of vast proportions, and
                                a wonderful victory to the science of bridge building. The Tay bridge is full as long
                                but it could not have been so much ot au undertaking as the river was not so deep nor
                                the spans so wide. The main incident of my visit to Dundee, was to hear the Hon. Andrew
                                Carnegie speak on the superiority of Republican institutions over the Monarchical. His
                                audience was composed of more than two thousand interested listeners. The eagerness with
                                which these Republican ideas were received would indicate that the time was not far
                                distant when England would accept this advanced form of government, and in this open the
                                way for the gospel testimony. I tarried in Dundee only two days and then returned to
                                Dunfermlinc. Here I was invited into the office of the<pb n="248" id="p10" TEIform="pb"/> Press,
                                where my time in conversation passed very pleasantly. By solicitation I wrote an
                                article, embodying, in brief, my life and experience, and sent the same to the office of
                                the Press. In this place I had the pleasure of meeting the President of the Vegetarian
                                Society, John Dava, a man of more than ninety years of age. lie was a marvel of activity
                                and can look back on a life spent in great usefulness. He was the founder of the first
                                "� Teetotal Society" in this world. My visit proved very interesting and very sati;
                                factory. On Monday morning I took the cars for Edinburgh, but not finding Elder John I
                                passed on to Huddersfield, and soon learned that he had gone on to London. After
                                enjoying a brief visit with the brother of Elder John I took the cars for Manchester. At
                                noon I left Manchester for London, and arrived tit the Eastern Station at 5 P. M. Here I
                                took an omnibus for Waterloo Bridge, aud then walked to Essex Street Strand. Here I
                                found myself again in the great city ; one in which my life was so wonderfully developed

                                find Elder John till late in the evening, but took a walk along ihe embankment of the
                                Thames as far as Black friar's Bridge. A great change has taken place since my last
                                visit. At that date the houses were all filled with families, but these are now gone and
                                their places occupied with offices for business purposes. One of the buildings is used
                                as the headquarters of the Salvation Army. On returning to the house I found Elder John.
                                We again crossed Blackfriar's Bridge, and saw much that was of interest to us. The next
                                morning Elder John went in company with some of his relatives, while I visited the
                                office of the London Vegetarian Society. I was cordially received by the Secretary, and
                                proffered cards of admittance to the meetings of the International Vegetarian Congress,
                                which was to assemble the next day. I was also invited to take breakfast at the Charing
                                Cross Vegetarian restaurant with the delegates to the Congrvs*. I visited the Memorial
                                Ila'l when the Congress was in session, and soon found myself among interested friends.
                                Among the letters that were read, one was from our Beloved Elder Frederic W. Evans, aud
                                one from the Rev. II. S. Clubb, President of the Vegetarian Society in America. I was
                                introduced as a representative of the Shaker Society in America and requested to give
                                information of the progress of vvgctariauisni in the United States. I told them ihaf the
                                letters which they had heard, had already given a full statement of the progress of the
                                work, and that our order were progressing more and more to adopt a pu'u diet, purity
                                beiug that to which we aim in our lives. A vote of sympathy was passed For the
                                vegetarians of the U. S. The meetings which I attended proved to be very interesting aud
                                1 considered my time very profitably spent. It wa~with a people who knew what it was to
                                deny the appetite of gross, animal food ; and their countenances and actions bespoke the
                                advanced course they had chosen to live. I visited the Kew Gardens, in company with the
                                delegates to the Congress, aud although it was a beautiful place, I found increased
                                enjoyment while in conversation on matters pertaining to the order of our gospel
                                    home.<pb n="249" id="p11" TEIform="pb"/> On Sabbath morning I took the boat for Kingston, to make
                                a call on some vegetarian friends, whose parents were visitors to the Concordium. At
                                this place I was introduced to the widow oi William Oldham. He was the founder of the
                                above order. As I did not reach Kingston till 2-30 P. M., I failed to meet many of the
                                friends who had extended invitations for me to call at their homes. On Monday I visited
                                the Editor of the "Medium and Day Break," James Burns, and I will send you a statement
                                of our meeting when published. Elder John returned to Huddersfield on the previous
                                Friday and on the 20th. of Sept. we meet again in Liverpool and sail for home in the
                                steamship Servia. A strong breeze was blowing as we left the port and in the night I was
                                very sick, as were many of the other passengers. My illness continued during the whole
                                voyage, while Elder John soon recovered and was very busily engaged in conversation.
                                Through the kindness of our dear friend Carnegie I was provided with some choice fruit,
                                which at this time seemed to be deeply appreciated. Our vessel reached New York on the
                                28th of Sept. where we were met by beloved Eldress Marion Patrick and Sister- Rhoda
                                Strowbridge. We reached home the day following where we were received by a hearty and
                                loving welcome, and Elder John passed on to his home in Shirley, Mass.</p></div3><div3 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div3"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Dear Editor:--I have thought many times I would contribute..."

                                number [ find therein a great deal of useful knowledge and instruction for which I wish
                                to thank the dear Brethren and Sisters, who are so willing to give us those instructions
                                which I know will be a benefit to each and every one of us who are willing to accept
                                them. It is by accepting these good instructions and trying to live up to them to the
                                best of our ability that we shall inherit that beautiful home which our heavenly Father
                                has prepared for all his children. In looking over the items from the different
                                Societies I find in the one from Harvard where our brother Andrew speaks of the
                                Providence of God in sparing them from any calamity of any kind. We have great reason to
                                be thankful to kind Providence in sparing us these many years from any disaster of any
                                kind. I want to say to my dear Brethren and Sisters that I am thankful that I am classed
                                among those who are trying to live consecrated lives and trying to do the will of their
                                Heavenly Father ; and my prayer is that God will bless every soul that will put an
                                effort forward to do his will and try to maintain the cause which our blessed Mother
                                established on earth. I often repeat the beautiful words which sister Mary Hazard sung

                            resolve very early in life, before the result of a wrong course has left its impression upon
                            the soul. We may liken the growth of a soul to that of a tree. When it is but a sapling it
                            receives some serious injury, but it continues to grow until the mar is entirely concealed
                            or outgrown : but finally a strong wind or tempest lays it low, and the broken trunk reveals
                            the defect which it received when young, and rendered it unable to withstand the gale. I

                            By Christ. The Author of "Kreutzer Sonata" Advances a Startling Theory That Celibacy Is
                                    Right and Marriage Wrong. Continued from October "Manifesto." [Translated from Count
                                    Tolstoi's Manuscript.] CONSCIENCE THE GUIDE. "Love God with all thy heart, all thy
                                    soul, and love thy neighbor as thyself." "As ye would that men should do to you, do
                                    ye also to them likewise." "Love your enemy." Such is Christ's doctrine. He gives no
                                    definitions of acts ; He only points to that imperishable ideal which every man
                                    finds in his own heart the moment it is revealed to him. For him who professes the
                                    formal doctrine the scrupulous fulfillment of the law is attainment of perfection
                                    and puts a stop to all further aspirations. Thus the Pharisee gives God thanks that
                                    he has fulfilled the law, and the rich young man is satisfied because he, too, has
                                    obeyed it. And it is impossible that they should think or feel differently, for
                                    having reached their actual level there is no other height visible toward which they
                                    might wend their way ; whereas, for him who professes Christ's doctrine the ascent
                                    of one summit is but a fresh incitement to climb to one still higher, whence another
                                    pinnacle is seen in the distance, and so on without end. The Christian is always in
                                    the position of the<pb n="251" id="p13" TEIform="pb"/> publican; ever painfully conscious of his
                                    own shortcomings, ever eager to advance as he looks at the long stretch before him
                                    that lies between him and his goal. The man who follows the outward, forward law may
                                    be aptly likened to one standing in the light of a lantern attached to an immovable
                                    post. He cannot see to go further than where he stands. On the other hand, he who
                                    hearkens to the promptings of his inner conscience is as one who carries a lantern
                                    before him on a long pole : the rays are always dispelling the darkness in advance
                                    of him, ever lighting him forward, ever leading him on to new spheres. Chastity and
                                    celibacy, it is urged, cannot constitute the ideal of humanity, because chastity
                                    would annihilate the race which strove to realize it, and humanity cannot set up as
                                    its ideal its own annihilation. It may be pointed out in reply that only that is a
                                    true ideal which, being unattainable, admits of infinite gradation in degrees of
                                    proximity. Such is the Christian ideal of the founding of God's kingdom, the union
                                    of all living creatures by the bonds of love. The conception of its attainment is
                                    incompatible with the conception of the movement of life. What kind of life could
                                    subsist if all living creatures were joined together by the bonds of love? None. Our
                                    conception of life is inseparably bound up with the conception of a continual
                                    striving after an unattainable ideal. THE RACE DOOMED ANYWAY. But even if we
                                    supposed the Christian ideal of perfect chastity realized, what then? We should
                                    merely find ourselves face to face on the one hand with the familiar teaching of
                                    religion, one of whose dogmas is that the world will have an end; and on the other,
                                    of so-called science, which informs us that the sun is gradually losing its heat,
                                    the result of which will in time be the extinction of the human race. If the lives
                                    of us Christians are characterized by such a frightful contradiction between our
                                    consciences and reality it is because we fail to understand the doctrine of Christ,
                                    which points to an unattainable, imperishable ideal, and in consequence allow
                                    ecclesiastical prescriptions, wrongly called Christian, to be substituted for the
                                    Christian ideal. This has been done in the matter of divine service, of apostleship,
                                    of power and of much else. The same thing has been done in respect to marriage.
                                    Christ not only never instituted marriage, but if we search the formal precept on
                                    the subject we find that he rather disapproved of it than otherwise. ("And every one
                                    that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife,
                                    or children, or land for my name's sake shall receive an hundred-fold and shall
                                    inherit everlasting life." Matt, xix., 25; Mark x., 29, 30; Luke xviii,, 29, 30.) He
                                    only impressed upon married and unmarried alike the necessity of striving after
                                    perfection. The churches, however, by endeavoring, contrary to Christ's teaching, to
                                    establish marriage as a Christian institution, failed to create a solid institution,
                                    and yet deprived the people of the guiding ideal set up by Christ. The upshot of
                                    this ill-advised effort was that the people flung away the old before receiving the
                                    new: they lost sight of the true ideal of chastity pointed out by Christ and
                                    embraced outwardly the ecclesiastical dogma of the sacrament of marriage, a doctrine
                                    that has been built upon no foundation whatever, and which men do not really and
                                    sincerely believe. This affords us a satisfactory ex lanation of the fact, which at
                                    first sight seems a strange anomaly, that the principle of family life and its basis
                                    (conjugal, fidelity) are found to be more firmly rooted among peoples who possess
                                    clear and minute external religious prescriptions on the subject�among Mohammedans
                                    and Jews, for instance�than among so-called Christians. The former have a code of
                                    clear, detailed external precepts respecting marriage, whereas the latter have
                                    nothing of the kind. It is only over a very insignificant fraction of the unions
                                    which they contract that the men and women of our society have a ceremony performed
                                    by the clergy to which they give the name of sacramental marriage; they then live on
                                    in polygamy and polyandry and giving themselves up to vice in the belief that they
                                    are practicing the monogamy they profess.<pb n="252" id="p14" TEIform="pb"/> CHRISTIAN MARRIAGE A
                                    FRAUD. Now, there is not and cannot be such an institution as Christian marriage,
                                    just as there cannot be such a. thing as a Christian liturgy (Matt, vi., 5-12; John
                                    vi., 21,) nor Christian teachers, nor church fathers (Matt. xxiii., 8-10,) nor
                                    Christian armies, Christian law courts, nor Christian States. This was what was
                                    always taught and believed by true Christians of the first and following centuries.
                                    A Christian's ideal is not marriage, but love for God and for his neighbor.
                                    Consequently, in the eyes of a Christian, relations in marriage not only do not
                                    constitute a lawful, right and happy state, as our society and churches maintain,
                                    but, on the contrary, are always a fall. Such a thing as Christian marriage never
                                    was and never could be Christ did not marry, nor did He establish marriage : nei�
                                    ther did his disciples marry. But if Christian marriage cannot exist, there is such
                                    a thing as a Christian view of marriage. And this i-s how it may be formulated. A
                                    Christian (and by this term I understand not those who call themselves Christians,
                                    merely because they were baptized and still receive the sacrament once a year, but
                                    those whose lives are shaped and regulated by the teachings of Christ.) a Christian,
                                    I say, cannot view tlie marriage relation otherwise than as a deviation from the
                                    doctrine of Christ�as a sin. This is clearly laid down in Matt, v., 28, and the
                                    ceremony called Christian marriage does not alter its character one jot. A Christian
                                    will never, therefore, desire marriage, but will always avoid it. Tf the light of
                                    truth dawns upon a Christian when, he is already married, or if, being a Christian
                                    from weakness he enters into marital relations with the ceremonies of the Church, or
                                    without them, he has no other alternative than to abide with his wife (and the wife
                                    with her husband, if it is she who is a Christian,) and to aspire together with her
                                    to free themselves of their sin. This is the Christian view of marriage; and there
                                    cannot be any other for a man who honestly endeavors to shape his life in accordance
                                    with the teachings of Christ. A TERRIBLE CONCLUSION. To very many persons the
                                    thoughts I have uttered here and in "The Kreutzer Sonata" will seem strange, vague,
                                    even contradictory. They certainly do contradict not each other, but the whole tenor
                                    of our lives, and involuntarily a doubt arises, "on which side is truth�-on the side
                                    of the thoughts which seem true and well founded, or on the side of the lives of
                                    others and myself?" I,. too, was weighed down by that same doubt when writing "The
                                    Kreutzer Sonata." I had not the faintest presentiment that the train of thought I
                                    had started would lead me whither it did. I was terrified by my own conclusions, and
                                    was at first disposed to reject it; but it was impossible not to hearken to the
                                    voice of my reason and my conscience. And so, strange though they may appear to
                                    many, opposed as they undoubtedly are to the trend and tenor of our lives, and
                                    incompatible though they may prove with what I have heretofore thought and uttered,
                                    I have no chance but to accept them. "But man is weak," people will object. "His
                                    task should be regulated by his strength." This is tantamount to saying : "My hand
                                    is weak. I cannot draw a straight line�that is, a line which will be the shortest
                                    line between two given points�and so, in order to make it mure easy for myself, T,
                                    intending to draw a straight, will choose for my inock'l a crooked line." The weaker
                                    my hand the greater the need that my model should be perfect.</quote><bibl default="NO" TEIform="bibl"><index level1="Philadelphia press" TEIform="index"/>(From the Philadelphia Press.)</bibl></cit></p><byline TEIform="byline"><persName reg="Tolstoi, Leon" TEIform="persName"/>Leon Tolstoi.</byline></div2><div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><head TEIform="head"><index level1="Our title deeds" TEIform="index"/> OUR TITLE DEEDS.</head><p TEIform="p"><cit TEIform="cit"><quote TEIform="quote">[Contributed by F.

                                    Vermont, who has been houored with a memorial tablet in Westminster Abbey, refused
                                    once in a court of justice to admit the validity of a certain slave-holder's title
                                    to the ownership of a runaway slave because NO DEED OP SALE FROM GOD ALMIGHTY could
                                    be produced transferring this negro to the claimant or his predecessors in title.
                                    There was evidence enough that the claimant had once got this human chattel by
                                    methods sanctioned by usage and by statute law, but the just<pb n="253" id="p15" TEIform="pb"/>
                                    judge perceived that the title was essentially defective. Whatever the claimant, or
                                    his father, might have paid for the negro ; how many hands soever the title might
                                    have passed through, it remained a kidnapper's title, for a kidnapper's title was
                                    all it was to begin with. The negro, like every other human being, had an
                                    inalieuable title to himself; �a title written, not on parchment, nor with the
                                    finger of man, but in nature and reason by the finger of (he Eternal. A common-place
                                    judge would have been satisfied with the slave-holder's title, because it was
                                    admitted valid by usage and statute law, and would have been blind to the negro's
                                    title to himself, because this was ignored by usage and statute law. But it was the
                                    glory of Judge Theophilus Harrington that, iu advance of his contemporaries, he
                                    believed in an Eternal Law of Righteousness, and held it to-be supreme. Those who

                                    traditions and customs to eternal principles, see A DEFECT IN EVERY LANDLORD'S
                                    TITLE. "The earth is the Lord's aud the fulness thereof; the world and they that
                                    dwell thereiu: for Hh hath founded it upon the seas and established it upon the
                                    floods." (Ps. xxiv., 1, 2.) No landlord can produce a deed of sale or of gift from
                                    the Almighty. No shred of evidence has he to show that what he calls his estate, and
                                    on which he wrings a heavy tribute from the toiling poor who till it and improve it,
                                    was designed by the Creator lor him rather than for his more induetrious brethren
                                    ;�no evidence that the coal for every ton of which he exacts a royalty was placed iu
                                    the bowels of the earth for his and his family's special behoof. His title, how
                                    ancient soever, or what price soever he may have paid for it to his predecessor, can
                                    be traced back historically to an origin in force or fraud�to an impudent usurpation
                                    of others' equal rights. Over against the essentially defective titles of the
                                    present landlord class to the exclusive ownership of the laud, there stands
                                    eternally the perfect title OF EACH HUMAN BEING to an equal share with all his
                                    fellows iu the natural opportunities and forces on the earth on to which he has been
                                    boru �a title written indelibly in nature and in reason ; and this title; of each
                                    can be practically recognized�in the present advanced state of civilization, under a
                                    system of division of labor, wherein most people do not earn their living by
                                    agriculture but by other forms of industry�only by the land bein" treated as the
                                    common property of communities, and the rent of advantages of fertility, mineral

                                    judges aud our legislators, for the most part, reflect average ignorance and
                                    stupidity. They acknowledge the defective parchment titles of the landlord class and
                                    ignore the perfect natural title of each human being aud of communities. But public
                                    opini&amp;u is advancing, aud with it law and judgment will have to keep pace.
                                    The fact that the private ownership of the land of a country by a few of its people
                                    is according to parliament made laws, and has been so for centuries, is no more
                                    proof that the institution is a just oue, than the fact that slave-owning was once
                                    legal, proved that slave-owning was right. Slave-owning was abolished in
                                    Englishspeaking nations, though long defended even by pious and well-meaning people,
                                    because it was at length seen by most citizens to be an iniquity. Land'ordisin will

                                    begins to see that Landlordism too is an iniquity, mother of more iniquities, and of

                                prosperity of the race. After four thousand years of "wars and rumors of wars" which had
                                filled the earth with sin and sorrow, we have this proclamation of Peace. It comes from
                                God, out of heaven, as an angel of love. Many honest and anxious souls had waited, for
                                days and years through hope of this divine promise. It came and a few chosen disciples
                                received it gladly, and faithful to the prophetic word of the servants of God, they
                                turned their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks and then
                                equally as faithful to the testimony of Christ, covenanted together that they would
                                learn war no more ; and during a term of two hundred years a Christian soldier could not
                                be found in the Roman army. To be the messenger of Peace, was to accept a mission which
                                would be like the dawning of a new day, and especially so at a time when the whole earth
                                was seemingly the farthest from such an enviable condition. Coming out as conquerors,
                                from some of the most savage battle fields, the iron heel of Rome had been placed on the
                                necks of the weaker nations, and this pseudo proclamation of peace had been sent from
                                the throne, but it was far from bringing the blessings of gospel peace to the many
                                downtrodden souls. To them it was as it had been for many long years, the voice of
                                slavery and the chains of servitude, subject to the bidding of an earthly potentate and
                                of his cruel task-masters. Peace on earth ! This voice came as the voice of an angel of
                                God to assure these earnest, prayerful souls that the day of their redemption was
                                approaching, and that a peaceful earth and new heavens, the abode of those who became
                                the peacemakers in the new creation of God wotdd be established in righteousness and
                                love. It was to be the fulfillment of a long cherished hope, which had been maturing in
                                    the<pb n="255" id="p17" TEIform="pb"/> minds of those who had accepted the promise of God.
                                Without this new revelation from God to man, the principles of a united brotherhood must
                                have remained inactive. No proclamation from king or emperor could ever secure to any
                                people the continuous growth of these heavenly treasures, which a community of
                                Christians must have if they would succeed in establishing a permanent home among men. *
                                Jesus seemed to realize this as he made reference to wars and rumors of wars that would
                                take place on the earth. Nation would contend against nation, that they might, in their
                                selfishness, dominate over those whom they were able to conquer. How carefully he gave
                                the needed instruction to his disciples. He says to them, "Learn of me." The disciple
                                must live as did the Teacher. His life must be the pattern ; and in this they have the
                                divine promise of Rest. It was the great gift of God to their souls. The whole mission
                                of Jesus was to lead his people to the kingdom of God and to teach them the government
                                of their own minds. How best to live among men that they might be called the children of
                                God. "Put up thy sword," said he, "for he that takes the sword shall perish with the
                                sword." The children of the spiritual kingdom must be peacemakers, must interest
                                themselves in the cultivation of Christian principles, and be able to conquer the world
                                in themselves. As the advocacy of the peace principle was so essential in the work of
                                redemption, our Communities should be as actively engaged, directly and indirectly, to
                                establish, permanently, on the earth, this great blessing of God. It is the "good news"
                                and "glad tidings" that has come to abide with the children of God. This gift now,
                                becomes our privilege and our treasure ; and will be secured for us in the kingdom of
                                heaven, "where moth and rust cannot corrupt." As disciples of our Lord the Christ, and
                                as members of a Christian Community, our testimony should be heard earnestly and
                                prayerfully, pleading for the manifestation of God's love to dwell in the hearts of men.
                                "Better is he that rules his own spirit, than he that conquers a city." This is the
                                government of self and if effectually accomplished, will be a victory over which there
                                is every reason to rejoice.</p></div3></div2><div2 type="publication" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div2"><p TEIform="p">Through the kindness of friends we are able to distribute several copies of the Manifesto

                                verdict rendered on the rain question, we have since found that there was "more to
                                follow." September rivaled its weeping predecessors ; but the heaviest rainfall since
                                September 1869 in cur locality, was between the 15th. and 18th. of the month. The earth
                                could hold no more and the water seemed to flow in sheets over the surface. We on the
                                mountain side with a succession of ponds and reservoirs above us had some cause for
                                alarm, until after much exertion, at just the right moment the floodgates were opened.
                                But what relieved us, added to the misery of the inhabitants of the valley below, and we
                                could look with commiseration on the spreading water in the valley, while the people
                                there were equally sympathizing with us as they saw the muddy torrents pouring over our
                                hillsides. The under-ground drains became so filled with driftwood, (and even fish) that
                                they refused to secrete the troubled waters, and sent them broadcast almost to our
                                doors; and for a time on the morning of the 17th. we were unable to ford the current by
                                the street fence without rubber boots; and we watched with anxiety as it crept closer to
                                our doors. But arduous and steady labor on the part of the Brethren, at last narrowed
                                the floods to their proper bounds, and we rejoiced that our well-made dams and
                                reservoirs had so nobly proved themselves. It will yet be some time probably before the
                                wash-outs will all be filled in as smoothly as before, for on surveying the premises the
                                next day we could but repeat the poet's words : "A morning-glory o'er a ruin The blue
                                sky seems to-day So worn and storm-clad is the earth, So prematurely gray." A. J. C.

                                crop in good condition; picked between three and four hundred bushels for winter supply
                                and have gathered Squashes, Beets and Beans. Cabbages are bursting open badly, partially
                                in consequence of excessive moisture and partly in being transplanted too early in the
                                season. Our people are much pleased with the appearance of the tile flooring in kitchen

                                Brother, T. Eatson. Sontli Family. Oct. 3, 1890. Dear Editor:�It is said "there is a
                                time for everything." We sometimes think there is, but not much time for writing. We are
                                enjoying these beautiful autumnal days and only wish they would tarry a long time,
                                before the snow comes and our picturesque scenery must go. We will make the best of the
                                coming winter, hoping that Oct. 1891 will find us all better and wiser. We are cutting
                                and drying sweet corn. It is very nice. Brother Henry is securing some good winter
                                apples ; not a full crop by any means. Last Sabbath day we met at the meeting-house
                                again. We have not missed once this season, there has been more speaking than ever. If
                                every one could preach as Elder Frederic Evans did last Sabbath, evil would not long be
                                in existence. Our Saturday evening meetings for prayer are very necessary, but not as
                                substantial as our Society meetings are. S. A.

The farm crops are nearly all secured, and we are moving along in "the even

                                weather which we lauded so highly, took its departure immediately, and we have been
                                blest with few pleasant days since. Yesterday was a day of rare beauty. In-<pb n="257" id="p19" TEIform="pb"/> spired by the glories that autumn unfolds, and the soft breezes that were
                                borne on the wings of the sweet scented air, we embraced the opportunity to enjoy a ride
                                to the celebrated town of Lenox. It was formerly the Shire-town of our county, and is
                                famed for being the home of several renowned authors. It is also distinguished for being
                                the summer resort of the lovers of the beautiful in nature ; and for people who, weary
                                and worn with the friction, bustle and din of city life, seek retirement and health
                                restoring tonics, that this grand old town, with its salubrious air, glorious scenery
                                and romantic beauty affords. As we wended our way thitherward, over hill and dale, past
                                field and forest, journeying now by the side of a murmuring rill, again passing near a
                                sheet of clear water, formed perhaps by the Omnipotent Creator; then another which may
                                have been artificially formed by man, we were forcibly impressed with the truth, that
                                all things possessing life, whether of the animal or vegetable kingdom, have their
                                seasons to live, grow and decay, while the human being alone holds in its animate form
                                an immortal spirit, which must and will exist eternally. The leaves, which a few weeks
                                ago wore a bright green, have taken on gorgeous hue?, as though in anticipation of a
                                return to mother earth, and the golden rays of the sun beaming upon everything, greatly
                                enhanced their beauty. We do not wonder that the people of densely populated cities are
                                attracted to this romantic town. The Co. who are working our ore-mine think the prospect
                                for obtaining large quantities of iron is bright, as a mountain of the best quality of
                                ore lies below the surface. They have made a new building and will sink another shaft,
                                thus increasing their facilities for more extensive operations. We have in our family an
                                enterprising German boy eleven years of age, who has the past season trapped nineteen
                                woodchucks, and it needs but one more to round up the score, two pole-cats added make
                                good the number. Jack Frost has made us several visits, impressing us thoroughly with a
                                knowledge of his presence on two occasions, by his rude behavior. To close our notes,
                                will state that we are being wonderfully blest with health in our little circle, as
                                there is not at present a name on the sick list. Hoping we may be able to appreciate our
                                manifold blessings we close; wishing you abundant success and prosperity. J. L.

                                having lived in it. The only thing for us is to do the present duty, no matter how
                                insignificant it may seem, and trust in God unquestioningly. Let us cherish a high
                                ideal, and try to live up to it; but forget not the little things of every day life and
                                need. Little by little great things are accomplished. The little things are frequently
                                the important ones. Lots of little things can be done now that may save many dollars in
                                the ne r future, when other and more important matters need looking after. The accepted
                                time is now. Swift the flying seasons pass, time is on the wing. It is the constant care
                                exercised over every part of the household, and constant endeavor to improve and apply
                                our be.-t powers to our work, that alone gives peace, happiness and prosperity. Our six
                                thousand strawberry plants Iook vigorous and give promise of a large crop next season.
                                Top onions yielded well. Our dooryard is improved by new fence and plank walk. We may
                                visit farm after farm, and see stables, cattle-sheds and stalls all erected on the most
                                improved style, but not the least provision made for the poor neglected hen, and yet she
                                will pay well if only treated like other stock. Properly managed compared to almost any
                                other business, the returns would be substantial. "Pratt's Poultry Food" is a good
                                egg-producer. All kinds of grain are best for hens when cooked with other food. D.

Dear Editor ;�October finds us pushing hard at the autumn work. We have
                                finished filling our silo for the second time. Our first ensilage was not entirely fed
                                out before<pb n="258" id="p20" TEIform="pb"/> we turnod the cattle out to grass. This yviir vre shall
                                commence the first of Nov. Our onion crop turned out splendidly, very near 100 bushels.
                                We lud almost two acres of* peas and beans which would have been No. 1, had nut the late
                                rains continued so long while curing them. Our yellow field corn is the best we ever
                                raised. Our herb crop which we depend upon to fill the Purse has been good. The herbs
                                are all harvested and dried. This sums up the temporalities. Our Society for the last
                                six weeks has been scourged more or less with the plague. God promised to take sickness
                                away from his people, and by the powerful remedies of God's sunshine and a cheerful
                                spirit guided by a clear conscience we are driving the plague back into Egypt where it
                                is said to have its origin. Elder John Whiteley was greeted with a welcome from his old
                                friends on Tuesday the 2nd inst. He seems to have stood the journey far better than our
                                expectations fancied. Sunday the 31st of August we attended meeting at the south family
                                :�something that had not happened before in Harvard for many years, and truly it was a
                                meeting of heavenly refreshment and good things. Friday the 5th, a company of gospel
                                friends from Alfred, Me., made us a short visit, viz. Br. Henry Green, Strs. Fanny
                                Casey, Mary Ella Douglas and Letta Pinder. They are children of the resurrection order.
                                They bear the fruits gained by a life of selfdenial. When it comes to my lot to be
                                associated with such souls I cannot restrain the prayer that goes out from the deepest
                                recesses of my soul. O that our ranks may again be filled with such examples of God's
                                boundless love and charity. "Let me wear out in the service. Let me never disgrace one
                                narrow spot of God's beautiful earth by wearing beneath its fresh, growing turf a

                                in the Oct. number. Wishing to hear from each Society, we would not send you too much at
                                one time. However, as good things, friendly calls, visits and precious associations of
                                Gospel kindred, do not lose flavor by keeping, we will note an enjoyable season of call
                                and visit in one unbroken chain of satisfaction which came to us, Sept. 11, and finally
                                closed Sept. 26.�Brother Samuel Kendrick, accompanied by four loving Sisters from
                                Gloucester, Me. [The length of this tarry may puzzle some who do not understand the
                                efficacy of rain at such seasons; but visitors, or "visited" can readily explain.]
                                Brother Samuel lived in Canterbury from boyhood to middle age, when, being one whom the
                                Lord and his Brethren and Sisters loved, hence chastened, he was asked to give his
                                services in other parts of the vineyard. The good Brother is a host in himself, and is
                                thus able to inspire from his wellsecured treasures of love and wisdom. He cast no
                                shadow, but comfort and peace followed him, proving that a consecrated Christian life
                                may be fraught with rays of mirthfulness which often add pleasure to the passing day.
                                His companions stirred afresh our love for all Gospel friends. Such loyal daughters are
                                above price as virtuous women�standard-bearers in Zion ! A call from Br. Daniel Orcutt

                                neighbors we have harvested medium crops of apples, pears and potatoes, and have
                                surprised ourselves in gathering about eighty bushels of peaches. At one period there
                                were fears of potatoes suffering from rust and rot, but with a change of weather, hope
                                and potatoes have<pb n="259" id="p21" TEIform="pb"/> revived. Our herdsman in lis care for the food

                                Post beets, and 200 bu. of Jumbo beets, and the Dairy tells the benefits. We have made
                                more extended repairs in several buildings than we anticipated in early spring and
                                rejoice to-day in many added conveniences, among which are several canopies over outside
                                doors. General Good Health is with our Society and we engage him for the winter. Our

                                profitably. It is really comforting to learn that our patron Society has "well-kept
                                lawns, orderly surroundings" which without doubt say to the passer by "Come;" and
                                although we know "Misery likes company" as a rule, there must be exceptions, for if we
                                cannot with propriety, say this of our home, wo joy that others are nearer the mark. Our
                                homes should be the best on earth, homes for both body and soul, not expensively
                                decorated but neat and orderly, hence attractive. If the consecrated earnings of "The
                                faithful" did not have to be doled out to hirelings, enough might be in the Lord's
                                treasury, to supply all Godly wants. Our Autumn term of schot&gt;l opened Oct. 6th, later

                                three hundred bushels, where we sometimes have ten, this will please the temperance
                                people, though I believe ours is mostly boiled for the famous cider sauce, or made into
                                vinegar for pickles. Potatoes enough, if used judiciously. We have no righteous cause
                                for complaint, only that we who are called to practically illustrate the possibilities
                                of our Order, are not better able to fulfill our mission, and that no more are led to a

                                And behold it came to pass during the past and present months that sowers went forth to
                                sow, and their sowing was the sowing of good and perfect wheat. And when they sowed, the
                                seed fell not by the wayside, therefore fowls came not to devour them up. Neither fell
                                any upon stony places, where they had not much earth ; forthwith to spring up because of
                                their lightness of soil. And when the sun was up, they were not scorched and because of
                                their de?p roots they withered not away. And the seeds fell not among thorns; therefore
                                when the thorns sprung up, they choked them not, for the thorns were far removed from
                                the wheat fields. But all fell into good ground, for the ground was well prepared; much
                                toil had so fashioned it, to bring forth fruit some a hundred-fold, and some sixty-fold,
                                and some thirty-fold. "Who hath ears to hear let him hear. Who hath eyes to see let him

                                In Gen. ix., 3 the word to Noah was, "Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for

                            God with all our heart and lean not unto thine own understanding;" and again, "Every word of
                            God is pure, He is a shield unto them that put their trust in Him." Knowing that we are not
                            strong enough of ourselves to resist evil, what a beautiful thought it is that we have a
                            merciful, loving Father who will, if we humbly apply to Him. hear our prayer and assist us
                            to do right. God has made many beautiful promsies to t;hose who love and obey Him, and if we
                            have faith and trust in his power we shall become more like our Great Exemplar. Hancock,

                                Galilee. "These friends were a little way off washing their nets. They had been at work
                                all night, but had caught no fish ; and now discouraged, had given up the attempt and
                                were getting their nets ready to put away. Jesus stepped into one of the boats, which
                                was Peter's, and motioning him to come, asked him to push out a little from shore. Peter
                                did so, and Jesus sat down in the boat and talked to the people on shore; afterwards he
                                turned to Peter and said; Go out a little farther from shore and let down your net."
                                Said Peter, "It is no sort of use; we have been at work all night long, and haven't
                                caught a fish," and I suppose that he farther explained that the night was the time for
                                catching fish, and if one failed then, it was folly to attempt by daylight. But I think
                                he saw something in Jesus' face which made him hasten to add; "Still, if you say so, we
                                will let down the net again." No sooner was it done than the fish were drawn into it in
                                such numbers that the net began to break, Peter and his brother Andrew were so
                                astonished that I suppose they hardly knew how to act." Published by John Y. Huber, Co.,

oat or tlie leniarkable experiment lcde
by Captain Pratt with a piriy c,\ radian
prisoners who were confined by the government in the old Spanish fort at St.
Augustine, Florida. These men, taken
red-handed on the war-path and imprisoned far from the scene of their crimes, as
being especially dangerous outlaws, were
so changed by Ca.pta.in Pratt's judicious
treatment and by the efforts of a few
Christian women for their instruction, that
many of them became anxious to learn
trades and to adopt habits of civilized
life. In order that a fair opportunity
might be given them to make this new departure, a few of their number were for a,
while taken to the Hampton negro training-school at Hampton, Virginia., and
were there set to work along with negro
boys. As these efforts promised success,
"the old government ban arks at Carlisle,
Pennsylvania, were fitted up as a trainingschool, and the work of Indian education
was there definitely begun under the
superintendeney of Captain Pratt. The
work for the negro at Hampton was
also .supplemented l�y the addition of
two hundred Indian pupils. These
two great schools, at which the India.n
youth of both sexes and drawn from
every tribe have been gathered, have been
an object lesson of the highest value to
the Indian cause. Doing thei � work openly in the heart of eastern civilization, they
have shown our most intelligent people,
what they may be pardoned for not having believed before, that under favoring
circumstances the Indian can be taught
all that is necessary to fit him for at least
an humble position in civilized life.�From
