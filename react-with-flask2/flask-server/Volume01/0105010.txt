Hark, from the depths... ' Hark, from the depths!' This wail comes from Philadelphia: ' I look upon the present laws and relations of marriage, as the direct source of more pauperism, crime, disease, and death, than rum, tobacco, war, pestilence, and famine; and I speak not at random when I say this. Tobacco, rurn, and war, are chiefly male accomplishments: pestilence and famine are confined to a few localities ; but marriage is nearly universal. No condition, sex, nor locality where human beings exist, is exempt from the curse of this human foe ! * * * * Perhaps I write too severely; if so, it is because I feel deepty that this truth is too true. * * * I have been in the camp of marriage; I know' the rottenness of every fibre of this gilded monster, and nothing shall shield it from my piercing shafts, until its death-throes sayâ€” 1 the deed is done !' ' Comments: There are thousands, who, having been caught in the beautiful spider's web of marriage, feel as the above correspondent. But this individual, and the majority of his sympathizers, would be among the last to live totally abstinent from the gratification of their sexual appetites. The Shakers look upon marriage, under Mosaic injunctions, to be honorable; but neither it nor the practice of any lasciviousness is, or can be Christian. Neither Jesus, Angels of God, nor the Shakers are ever afflicted with the pangs of matrimony ; neither soiled by sexual uncleanness nor individual vices. *
