Which is Nobler, the Aesthetic or the Ascetic? Were there no sin confronting us at every step in life, with its general accompaniments of poverty, want and wretchedness; were there no ignorance, with its lack of happiness and growth, chafing continually upon the benevolent and philanthropic elements in our being, the gratification of our taste for the beautiful would not seem so contrary to the genius of Christianity. We all believe that we shall have them ultimately to enjoy, unless like the rich man in the parable we have ' had our good things in this life ' at the expense of the 'durable riches and life evermore' which are the product of practical love to the Lord, and to our neighbor. E. H. W.
