Truth's Mission All hail with joy the blessed day, That gospel truth may wing its way O'er this heaven-favored land of ours, To aid the soul's expanding powers. O, may it enter every heart, And quenchless light and faith impart; Until the kingdom here shall come, To be the humble seeker's home. O, Gospel, gentle as a dove, Thine olive branch of peace and love Shall guide the weary traveler's feet, Through fields where hostile armies meet. For in earth's-field of toil and strife, The soul that seeks the higher life Will, by thy talismanic charm, Be kept secure from every harm. Thou art the very Source of Truth,— A lamp alike to age and youth.— From each polluting thing a shield, For all in thee, to God are scaled. Bright Gospel, let thy glory roll In thunder tones from pole to pole; And wake the slumbering ones of earth, To struggle for the heavenly birth. Yea, cast the veil of night aside, And break the bands of sin and pride ; Unto the sorrowing race of man Reveal salvation's lowly plan. L. A. Woodward, Whitewater, O.
