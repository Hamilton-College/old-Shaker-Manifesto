The Setting Sun The setting sun resplendent shone, And bade the earth farewell ; Soon night's deep shades will intervene, And cast upon each lovely scene Ita dark and silent spell. Yet weep not thou, but humbly bow— God worketh not in vain ; Although beneath the stormy wave, The brilliant orb sinks in the grave, 'Twill rise, 'twill rise again, 'Twill rise again, 'twill rise again; Although beneath the stormy wave, The brilliant orb sinks in the grave, 'Twill rise, 'twill rise again. What then, if here the silent tear Doth oft unbidden roll; While every joy that filled the heart, In sorrow seemeth to depart, And darkness veils thy soul; Yet fear not thou, but humbly bow— Thy tears aie not in vain; Although beneath the stormy wave, Thy sun of gladness make its grave, 'Twill rise, 'twill rise again, 'Twill rise again, 'twill rise again ; Although beneath the stormy wave, Thy sun of gladness make its grave, 'Twill rise, 'twill rise again. John Robe, Mt. Lebanon
