Light Father of Light, in thee we trust. From thee all blessings flow; Thy ways are ever true and just, A nd thou all hearts doth know. O, may we walk with humble fear, Each day within thy sight; And may our constant, fervent prayer Be, 'Father, give us light!' O, grant to us thy mercy, Lord, To save us from our loss; Thy power, and thy quickening word, With faith to bear the cross,â€” O, leave us not, when storms arise, Dark clouds heave up in sight; But guide us in thy way so wise, To light, more perfect light. If we should err, or go astray, Or thy least law forget, O, point us to the narrow way, Thy truth hath wisely set. Then, in thy temple, while we've breath, We'll praise thee with delight; That thou hast raised our souls from death, To light, effulgent light. Polly Lewis, Mt L.
