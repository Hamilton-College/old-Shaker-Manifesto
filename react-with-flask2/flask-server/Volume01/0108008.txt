Those who fix their eyes on the sermon on the Mount... 'Those who fix their eyes on the sermon on the Mount, or rather on the naked propositions it contains, and disregard Christ's life, his cross and his resurrection, commit the same mistake in studying Christianity, that the student of Socratic philosophy would commit if he studied only the dramatic story of his death. Both Socrates and Christ uttered remarkable thoughts and lived remarkable lives. But Socrates holds his place in history by his thoughts and not by his life ; Christ, by his life, rather than by his thoughts.'â€”Ecce Homo.
