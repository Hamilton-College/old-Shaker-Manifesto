A Young Vegetarian Grace Bowers, aged eight years, having eaten no meat nor butter for five years, is healthy and intelligent, always waking up in the morning laughingâ€”an infallible test of good temper. Grace was sent to the Office upon an errand, when one of the Sisters kindly offered her a piece of white bread and butter, with some sugar upon it (not knowing her vegetarian- ism). ''I do not eat white bread nor butter,' said Grace. ' Well, Grace, what do you eat ?' ' I eat brown, unleavened bread; but I do not need anything now, for I have just eaten a good dinner.' Any boy or girl who will thus subject appetite to a principle, is laying a solid foundation for a useful character. F. W. Evans
