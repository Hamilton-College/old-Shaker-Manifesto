'Should Christians Dance?' A correspondent of The Religious Telescope, Dayton, 0., asks, ' Should Christians Dance ?' it answering in the negative, expresses wonder, that any one who believes in giving both soul and body entirely to God's service, should ask such a question. We wonder if it ever read of David's dancing before the ark ' with all his might 1' Of the beautiful daughter of the high priest, who went forth with timbrels and dances to greet the conquerors ? Does it recall the circumstance, that when the prodigal son returned, he heard music and dancing ? and that out of that house came one, representing our heavenly Parent, God ? Will it be so good as to read the 12th and 13th verses of 31st Jeremiah, and ponder, particularly long on the latter verse ? We are glad to hear this question asked. Will not some anxious ones inquire, ' Should Christians Fight or Marry, or gratify their appetites in unchristian lusts ? should Christians hold private property ? should the Christians of one Church be both rich and poor ? if so, by whose authority or permission ? did the founder of Christianity inaugurate the new doctrine by permitting the above licenses or by abrogating them ?' There are many practices, worse than dancing, in which professional Christians engage without any seeming compunction; but which are disgraceful, and impossible for the practical follower of Christ to endorse. Admitting that David and Miriam were not Christians, yet they are revered by professional Christians, who seem to take no umbrage at their acts. We assert, that Christians do dance; and further, that when professors of Christianity shall all have forsaken their fleshly lusts, their pride, and worldly ambitions generally, they will dance with great joy at their deliverance from these bonds ; and still further, that the clergy of to-day, will be amo?ig the most powerful dancers. *
