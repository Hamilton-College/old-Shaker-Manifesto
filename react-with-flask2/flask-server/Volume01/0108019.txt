'According to Your Works.' In the ' Book of Common Prayer,' we read, at the close of the ' Lord's Prayer,' the fol- lowing addendum :—Minister : ' 0 Lord, deal not with us according to our sins !' Congre- gation : ' Neither reward us according to our iniquities !' This is a first class representation of the lesson human nature has learned from the text, ' Thou shalt not surely die.' Pleasure, regardless of its character, depraved human nature will have; but the just reward of iniquitous doings it shrinks from; to escape pay-day is very desirable. Rather, slay the Lamb, use his skin, or character, for a covering ; his blood for an atonement; and thus disguised, run the gauntlet of justice, and look for the reward of heaven, unearned, gratuitously! Poor human nature! 'Behold, I come quickly.' * * * * Should we, in the employ of one government, look to another for our compensation ? Why should we look to God for reward, if our services have been engaged in the works of the Devil ? If we have the reward of the righteous, we must live the life of the righteous. If we sin, we shall reap the reward of sin—death. If we sow to the flesh, we shall reap the opposite of peace, purity; and our abode here, and hereafter, will be where those who ' sow to the spirit, and walk not after the flesh with its affections and lusts,' would not, could not dwell. May the good God not depart from the holiness of his promise, but ' reward us according to our works ;' and may we so live as to expect, and joyfully meet the consequences. The best way to escape the punishment of sin, is to stop sinning. Isaac Anstatt
