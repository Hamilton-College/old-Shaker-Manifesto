The Flowers I walked through a beautiful garden so green, My heart was quite filled with delight at the scene; The flowers were all blooming, most gorgeously dressed; But soon sad emotions my spirit depressed; For this thought came o'er me : How short is your stay, Ye beautiful flowers, so brilliant and gay ? With leaves now expanding, with colors so bright, And buds bursting sweetly the eye to delight; Refreshed by the dews of the morning so fair, Exhaling sweet odors, perfuming the air; But all those enchantments, so gay to the eye, Though rich in their beauty, soon wither and die. The beautiful summer!â€”how soon it is o'er, And the bloom of the flowers is remembered no more; But deep in the heart that is free from all stain, There are flowers that bloom, and their beauty retain; No rough wintry storms, nor fierce tempests that roll Can harm those sweet flowers that bloom in the soul; 'Mid the hot scorching rays of earth's fierce summer SUllj Their freshness and vigor appear just begun. They will blossom anew in that heavenly land, Where joys are eternal and beauties expand; Where pure crystal streamlets continually roll To water those flowers that bloom in the soul.
