Unity, the Bond of Peace We'll cling to each other in friendship. In purity, peace, and true love ; We'll imitate Jesus' example, And live like the angels above. Jesus said, ' Ye must love one another, By this your discipleship's known;' So all other tokens are useless, Where this blessed mark is not shown. We'll move ever onward and upward, Away, far away from the earth, Together seek heavenly treasures Of eternal substance and worth. The spirit is calling us loudly, To work with more earnest desire; True action is living to purpose. And draws us to God ever nigher. We'll liveâ€”live by love and good actions, The cross, self-denial and right; Time is fleeting, earth's joys are transient, But heaven hath endless delight. 'Tis only the faithful are crowned, So let us work on with a zeal, Not weary, but labor in earnest, And God will His treasures reveal. (Hancock.) J.
