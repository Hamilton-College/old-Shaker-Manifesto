The World What is tfi-e world!? A blinding maze, 'Where'sin hath marked ten thousand ways, Its victims to ensnare; They're broad, they're winding, and aslope, They're void of truth, and void of hope, All ending in despair. Millions of travelers throng these roads, Borne down by sin in heavy loads. To dark and dismal night. One humble path, thai never bends, Narrow, yetrongh and steep, ascends froM darkness into light. Ir there no guide to show that path ? The Gospel! He alone who hath The Gospel, need not stray; But he who hath, yet doth not give The Gospel light that souls may live, Himself shall lose the way.
