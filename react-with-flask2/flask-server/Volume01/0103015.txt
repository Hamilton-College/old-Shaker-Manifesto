HYMN OF PltAISE In harmony with nature's voice, we'll chant a hymn of praise, [n our Creator's works rejoice, and glory in his ways. Our hearts are now attuned to sing the glories of the year. Praise to the source from whence they spring, Our life to bless and cheer, our life to bless and cheer. The blessings of this social feast, As a rich boon are given ; Among attractions not the least, To lead our souls to heaven. O happy home ! relation dear ! With these onr hearts are blest, Praise, love and thanks we render here, This hallowed day of rest. N. F., Mt. Lebanon
