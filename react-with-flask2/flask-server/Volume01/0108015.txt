I feel the Divine hand has guided my way... ' I feel the Divine hand has guided my way; and though the full hour has not arrived for the opening of your door to me, yet some day it will open, and angel hands will guide the way, and Mother Ann will lead me in the paths of wisdom and love. ... 'The Shaker' blesses me ; I rejoice in its advent to the world; it will do good, for those who read it cannot fail of feeling its heavenly mission.' C. S. L., Ohio.
