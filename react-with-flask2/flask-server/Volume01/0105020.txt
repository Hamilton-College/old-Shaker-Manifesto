To 'owe no man aught but love and good will'... To 'owe no man aught but love and good will,' is a fundamental principle of Shaker faith. Any persons, therefore, trusting a Shaker, for longer or shorter periods, must do so at their own risks, and without the sympathy of Society. None, within the precints of Shaker Society, not excepting its officers, have any right to contract a debt. * Love is not lust; these two are opposite. Oil and water cannot blend ; neither the generation of the earthly with the resurrection of the heavenly. We cannot live fleshly lires, and at the same time be Children of the Insurrection. *
