How to make a Shaker To make a Shaker is to confess your sins honestly, live purely like the little spirits in heaven; you must not hide your sins, because you do not like to confess them; you cannot hold them forever; you will be found out before long, by the light of truth, which will urge you to confess them. You cannot have your own way unless it be right; but will have to obey what you are taught; you will not be allowed to be unclean, nor tell falsehoods among the Shakers, without honestly confessing and repenting of them. If you do not do this, you cannot make a Shaker, because the people will not bear it very long. This is true, for I have been taught all this, and more. If I had room I would write you some more about it. Gertrude, Canterbury
