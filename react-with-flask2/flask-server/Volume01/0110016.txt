What hidden works of darkness lie shrouded... What hidden works of darkness lie shrouded beneath the mask of base deception—of speeches fair, and colors false! Oh! the depth of human depravity. It is honorable to be great; it is excellent to be small. ' Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me; for of such is the kingdom of heaven.' Plough deep the fallow ground of the heart, sow and cultivate the seeds of purity, love and truth, and you will reap a rich harvest of true felicity. What is hell?—A condemned conscience.

Is there not more hope of him than of a professing Christian saint, who sins daily and seeks to hide his iniquity ? Prayer, like a golden key, unlocks treasures of inestimable value. Be careful which way you turn it.
