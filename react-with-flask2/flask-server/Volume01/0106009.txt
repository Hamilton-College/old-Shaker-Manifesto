The Weaver I've laid my web for life, And now I'm left to fill it; With care and daily strife, Or ease, if I so will it. An even thread, and strong, WiD weave me sure protection; A ' linsey woolsey ' one Will break, and cause vexation. And when the work is done, 'Twill make my seamless garment; Or, clothe my soul upon, In sad and sackcloth raiment. M. W.
