Dr. Franklin, in summing up the evils of drunkenness... Dr. Franklin, in summing up the evils of drunkenness, says: 'Houses without windows, gardens without fences, fields without tillage, barns without roofs, children without clothing, principles, morals or manners.' I Can't.—'Shame on you, the expression is bad enough on the tongue of infancy. To that of manhood or womanhood it is a disgrace. How do you know you 'can't'? Have you tried ? Well, if you have, try once more. The task before you may be very difficult. What if it is? It is then often the more worthy of performance. Courage, then, young man, or young woman, whoever you be ! Resolve to know no such word as 'can't.' '—College Review.
