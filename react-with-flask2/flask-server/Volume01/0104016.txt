Editor's Notes Attention is called to the address of Wm. Leonard, ' Ayer, Muss..' changed from 'Groton;' also, a change in 'Mt. Morris' agency. Individuals sending articles for publication will regard the spirit, of the 'Circular' issned to Believers. The Editor's drawer, though nearly full of good matter, will hold some more. We want a wider sphere of contributions ; some think we are acting on too contracted a scaleâ€”the reason is, we have not yet heard from the East nor West, but in small degree. Remember, The Shaker is the organ of the United Societies. We want short articles ; full of pith, testimony, and true to life. We repeat: we will send one copy extra tor five subscribers.
