True Love Words by E. T. Leggett. Music by G. A. Lomas. 1 Purer than the skies of even, brighter than the morning sun, Is that angel love from heaven, blending all our hearts in one; Now like rippling waters meeting, murmuring gladness to our ears, Now within our hearts 'tis beating, marches to the brighter spheres. 2 Oh, it is a glorious feeling, deep'ning as we heavenward go, Spotless as the sunlight, stealing softly through the felling snow; 'Tis a fount of living waters, with rich blessings running o'er, Where all Zion's sons and daughters, drink of bliss and thirst no more. 3 Love will heal the broken hearted, it will cure the stricken soul; Twill unite whom death lias parted, where no waves of sorrow roll. It will triumph when the mountains, time, at last, shall overthrow, And when silent, all life's fountains, love shall bright, still brighter glow. 4 Like the light of hope that's beaming, o'er the dark clouds rolling high, Love reveals far o'er them gleaming, brighter worlds beyond the sky. Grant, thou Great Almighty Giver, o'er our wild and bleak domain, Love may, like lost Eden's river, make this world to bloom again. 5 'Tis to God and to each other, love unites us heart and hand, And will guide us, sister, brother, homeward to the promised land; While we pray to be forgiven, while we hope for heaven above, May our strife be all for union, and our contest all for love.
