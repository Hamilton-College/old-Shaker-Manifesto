Answers to Correspondents ' Editor of The Shaker i ' Some things I would like to know . Do you have revelations from the spirit world, as of old, or at all ? and, if not, what is the cause ? ' Second: What do you think is to be the ultimate of the' orthodox churches ? Will they grow to a spiritual life ? or will they ' wax worse and worse ? ' '• Please answer through ' The Shaker.' '•E. F. Curtis.' Answer. We have just such kind of communications as we desire and labor for, whether rapping, table-tipping, moving of matter, or the deepest spiritual inspiration. Second : The ultimate of the orthodox churches will be,—a part will remain in their dead materialism ; retrograde into infidelity to their orthodox theologies; or will settle down in pantheistic atheism. A large part will progress into Spiritualism ; and the coming conflict will be between these two classes—mate- rialists and spiritualists. The latter will ultimately prevail, progressing out of the rudimental—the generative—into the Angel order, in this life, keeping the higher law of celibacy. J. S. P.
