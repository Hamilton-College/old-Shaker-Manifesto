Kotes :—The Shaker is hailed with joy by the United Societies. We issued 7.000 of January number ; think we shall need to use the plates again. Subscriptions come in rapidly. Our object is to disseminate truth far and near. Think it will be what we most desire it should be—a home educator. It is proposed to send free, one copy for every club of five. Samples at six cents, including postage. Exchanges nade with the Press, where desirable. Any person addressing the Board of Editors, or Resident Editor, requesting answers, will enclose stamp. United Societies, let us hear from you; send us your best thoughts, rom three lines to a column of lines. G. A. L., Res. Ed
