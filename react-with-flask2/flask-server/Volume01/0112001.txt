Shaker Iconoclasm While millions are seeking their heavens in the indulgences of perverted passions, »e are called to work ours out by severe chastisement of our affections for sinful lusts—by rigid self-denial to all that engenders worldly ambition or selfish aggrandizement. After thousands of years' activity in the habitual practices of war, marriage, private property; of carnal desires, and the gratification of those desires by our ancestors; we are commanded to turnback the tide of nature, and build the foundations of a new structure, that condescends not to the use of a single material, good nor bad, that constitutes the bulwarks of the old order of life! Who, then, wonders at our persecution ? Who is surprised at the few who bear the ordeal and comply with the command ? Or who wonders at the worldly cry of the failure of Shakerism, and the desires that it should fail, while it is making such devastation with worldly institutions? It has already proved itself a successful re- generator; and what has been done by it, can with it be accomplished again. *
