Gospel Treasures Should we take the bright wings of the^morn And soar over mountain and sea, From isles that old ocean adorn, To lands where the bright flowers be; Should the mountains unbosom their gold, And ocean her jewels restore. Should earth all her treasures unfold, Our spirits would still thirst for more. There are far reaching depths in the soul, No phantoms of pleasure can fill; There are wild waves of passions that roll, No power but of Heaven can still: There's a heart sad and lonely within, A hunger for good from above; There's a deep seated sorrow for sin, And thirst for pure Heavenly love. There's a happiness purity brings, Contentment the gospel bestows; There's a hope in the trusting heart springs, Triumphant o'er earth and its woes: There's a treasure of bliss far away, Reserved for the righteous in store; And the bright morn is dawning to-day That never knows night any more. There are pleasures that never grow old, And hopes that will never decay; There's a wealth that is richer than gold, To all who the gospel obey. Rejoice, then, ye faithful and true, Your day of salvation has come; The bright crown of glory in view, Invites to your Heavenly home. E. T. Leggett. Union Village, Ohio, Aug. 1871
