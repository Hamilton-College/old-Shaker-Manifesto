Items Behold the latter day appears, And things mysterious greet our ears, Which seems to make this wise demand, ' Let him that readeth, understand.' It has been asserted that the Shaker males hate the females, and vice versa. This is not true; we love each other better than we can express. * It has been said, ' The Shakers are the followers of an ' old woman !' ' This is not true in any wise: If ' old woman ' is intended to signify Ann Lee's age, it is false, as she never lived to be aged. As Ann Lee made it the work of her life to crucify the old woman and her deeds of depravity, the Shakers can more consistently be called the followers of the new man (Jesus), and the new woman (Ann). * Right and Wrong.â€”' If you don't go to school, my son, who will teach you what is right or wrongr' ' I don't get teacht, I find it out.' ' And how do you find it out ?' ' By observing that right works for a shilling an hour, while wrong lives on it!'' All persons able to walk should exercise daily in the open air. ' Be careful lest a too warm desire for distinction should deceive you into pursuits that may cover you with shame, by setting your incapacity and slender abilities in full light.'
