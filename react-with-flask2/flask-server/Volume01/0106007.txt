'The Servant of the Lord must be Gentle.' 2d Tim. 2:24. Gentle words and gentle actions, Tokens of a tender heart: When to all they render kindness What rich blessings they impart! Thus, when clouds of sorrow lower, And the soul is bow'd with care, Gentle words with magic power, Strengthen us to trials bear. Let us cultivate those virtues Which adorn and beautify ; Clothe the soul with heavenly graces And to angel3 bring it nigh. Peace and love, and tender kindness, Breath'd around us as we go, Scatter all the selfish blindness Which prevents pure love to flow. L. W., Whitewater
