Sweet Innocence Sweet Innocence, of beauty rare ! What virtue can with thee compare ! Who can behold thy glory bright, And not embrace thee with delight? O blessed virtue—richest grace ! How brilliant shines thy lovely face ! O could vain mortals know thy worth, And seek thee, in the days of youth. Through every stage of human life, Thou canst appear for man's relief, And greatly wilt thou beautify The soul, that dost on thee rely. We view thee oft in infant state, In child-hood—and, on youth to wait,— But, as wild nature bears the sway We see thee drawing far away. Too oft, in social life, we find A stranger thou, to youthful mind ; And as in years they riper grow, Thy kind address they scarcely know. Oh, sad mistake ! Oh. blinded youth ! How little dost thou sense the worth Of this most precious gift of heaven, Which, to the child of grace is given. No ornament of nature's birth Can e'er compare with thee, in worth : And where thon gainest full control, Thy glory bright will crown the whole. In thee, all other virtues bloom, Diffusing round their rich perfume, Which intermingle with thy own, As in a child of grace is shown. Oh Innocence ! Thou sweetest charm ;— Thou canst the cruel tyrant calm !— The proud, the haughty, and the wild Must bow to thee, thou lovely child : Yea, monarchs, kings and princes, all Must reverence thee—before thee, fall;— And, as thy Christ-like hand is sought, All worldly charms are brought to naught.
