'A Concise Statement OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE SHAKER CHURCH, ACCORDING TO THE GOSPEL OF THE PRESENT APPEARANCE OF CHRIST, AS HELD TO AND PRACTISED BY THE FOLLOWERS OF THE LIVING SAVIOUR 1st. We believe that the first light of salvation was given or made known to the patri- archs by promise ; and they that believed in the promise of Christ, and were obedient to the command of God made known unto them, were the people of God, and were accepted of Him as righteous, or perfect in their generations ; according to the measure of light and truth manifested unto them ; which was as water to the ancles signified by Ezekiel's vision of the holy waters (chapter 47). And altho' they could not receive regeneration or the fullness of salvation from the fleshly or fallen nature in this life; because the fullness of time was not yet come, that they should receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire ; for the destruction of the body of sin, and purification of the soul, but Abram being called, and chosen of God as the father of the faithful, was received into covenant relation with God by promise; that in him (and his seed which was Christ) all the families of the earth should be blessed, and these earthly blessings, which were promised to Abram, were a shadow of gospel or spiritual blessings to come: and circumcision, though it was a seal of Abram's faith, yet it was but a sign of the mortification and destruction of the flesh by the gospel in a future day. Observe, circumcision did not cleanse the man from sin; but was a sign of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire : which is by the power of God manifested in divers operations and gifts of the spirit, as in the days of the apostles ; which does in deed destroy the body of sin, or fleshly nature, and purify the man from all sin, both soul and body. So that Abram, though in the full faith of the promise, yet as he did not receive the substance of the thing promised, his hope of eternal salvation was in Christ, by the gospel to be attained in the resurrection from the dead. 2d. The second dispensation was the law that was given of God to Israel, by the hand of Moses ; which was a further manifestation of that salvation which was promised through Christ by the gospel, both in the order and ordinances which was instituted and given to Israel, as the church and people of God according to that dispensation ; which was as waters to the knees, Ezekiel 47, by which they were distinguished from all the families of the earth. For, while they were strictly obedient to all the commands, ordinances, and statutes, that God gave them, they were approbated of God according to the promise for life; and blessing was promised unto them in the line of obedience : cursing and death, in disobedience : for God, who is ever jealous for the honor and glory of his own great name, always dealt with them according to his word ; for while they were obedient to the command of God and purged out sin from amongst them, God was with them, according to his promise. But when they disobeyed the com- mand of God, and committed sin, and became like other people, the hand of the Lord was turned against them ; and those evils came upon them which God had threatened; so we see that they that were wholly obedient to the will of God, made known in that dispensation, were accepted as just, or righteous : yet as the dispensation was short, they did not attain that salvation which was promised in the gospel; so that as it respected the newbirth, or real purification of the man from all sin, the law made nothing perfect, but was a shadow of good things to come; their only hope of eternal redemption was in the promise of Christ, by the gospel to be attained in the resurrection from the dead. Acts of the Apostles xxvi. 6, 7. 3d. The third dispensation was the gospel of Christ's first appearance, in the flesh : and that salvation 'which took place in consequence of his life, death, resurrection, and ascension at the right hand of the Father, being accepted in his obedience, as the first- born among many brethren, he received power and authority to administer the power of the resurrection and eternal judgment to all the children of men; so that he has become the author of eternal salvation to all that obey him ; and as Christ has this power in himself, he did administer power and authority to his church at the day of pentecost, as his body: with ail the gifts that he had promised them, which was the first gift of the Holy Ghost, as an indwelling comforter to abide with them forever; and b}' which they were baptized into Christ's death; death to all sin ; and were in the hope of the resurrection from the dead, through the operation of the power of God, which wrought in them. And as they had received the substance of the promise of Christ come in the flesh, by the gift and power of the Holy Ghost, they had power to preach the gospel in Christ's name to every creature, and to administer the power of God to as many as believed, and were obedient to the gospel which they preached, and also to remit and retain sin in the name and authority of Christ on earth.
