Morning A brighter day is dawning, Blest Zion, upon Thee ! I see the rays of morning-, Now gilding spire and tree— I see the cloud-capped mountain Take on a golden line. As up the eastern horizon The snn appears in view. Arise ' and shake thy garments ; Thy night of rest is gone .' Arrayed in thine adornments, Come forth to meet the morn I Hail, with a joyful greetingThe Messenger of Light' Before whose face retreating, Are seen the shades of night. Come, ix;vr, and view the landscapes So splendid to behold ; ¦While Light, as with a mantle, drapes The Earth in limpid gold. See. Iittle; pearly drops of dew All sparkling with delight; Soon these will vanish from onr view, As have the shades of night. Tor, as the Sun ascendeth higher, The glided Glory fades ; While radiant Light, like heat from fire, The shadiest nook invades. All who within the forest stand, Are shielded from bright rays ; While those who cultivate the land, Work in the Sun's !&gt;road blaze. So, well improve these golden hours E'er they have passed away ; On wings, the Morning upward soars To full Meridian day. 'Arise and work,7' is duty's call; Come forth, the vineyard prune ; And renovate the broken wall Upon the^rovmd now strewn. Tor, all the beasts that roarn the fields, Can enter when they please ; And whatsoever fruit it yields, Appropriate with ease. Let more security ensure The product of this soil, Although the laborers are fewer Who in the vineyard toil. A. E. P., Har.
