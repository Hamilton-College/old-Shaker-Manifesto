My Home My Shaker home, my happy home! No spot on earth so dear to me ; And if abroad my thoughts do roam, They soon return again to thee. The trees, the houses and the land, Are pleasant objects to my eyes; And dearer still, a loving band— Companions dear, I love and prize. My faith, more precious still, I find Is that which holds me in this way; Not earth, with all her wealth combined, Can lure me from my home to stray. Most hallowed spot, my Shaker home! My interest and my all ;s in thee! And from thee I will never roam, There's naught on earth so dear to me. And while life's journey I pursue, In my sweet home I love so well, I'll keep my heavenly home in view— My future home, where angels dwell. J. C. Jilson, Shirley
