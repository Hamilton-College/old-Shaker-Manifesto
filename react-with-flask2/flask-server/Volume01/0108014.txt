Adam, the first, was created... ' Adam, the first, was created a natural man of the earth. Adam, the second, was jorn a spiritual man from the heavens.' Here we have two distinct orders of beings, each belonging to its respective head or parentage. As it is written: ' That which is first was not spiritual, but natural, and afterward that which was spiritual,' it is reasonable to suppose, had not Adam transgressed and fallen m his generative order, there would have been a necessity for him to have progressed into a spiritual order; and it is fair to suppose that, as a natural, rational being, the transition from a generative to a regenerative life would have been easj to what it is now, as a poor, blinded, fallen being. Then, if there was a necessity for man, before the fall, to progress to a higher state of manhood, out of one order to another, how much greater necessity now that man is unnatural, irrational and fallen. ' You must be born again,' is the language of Christ to Nicodemus, and ' you must be born again,' is the language of fallen humanity repeated to itself daily, as it wallows in its own corrupt blood, or lingers in constant pain. Then Christian regeneration, as we understand it, is the coming out of the old generative order —putting off the old man with his deeds, which are ever corrupt after the flesh, and by putting on the new man who is spiritual—even the Christ from the heavens. Jesus calls all men to follow him (not Adam, nor Moses), in the regeneration, and become new creatures, by the washing or cleansing process of a Christian life, as it is in Himself, the Christ—the Lord from heaven.
