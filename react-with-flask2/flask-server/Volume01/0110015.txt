Draw Nigh There was a law among the ancient Persians, that whomsoever should present themselves before the king, unless they were called to his presence, should be put to death, except such to whom the king should extend the golden sceptre. (See Esther, iv:ll.) But in this our day we have no such prohibition. The sceptre to us is always extended. And it is a sceptre of mercy. The still small voice says come. It is a general and universal invitation, from our glorious King, to draw nigh at all times, and in all circumstances, by prayer and devout supplication, to make known our desires to Him. And we may freely address Him, not only as the Eternal, the Almighty, Creator of all things, but as our heavenly Father and Mother. It is not in the spirit of bondage, or of fear, that we may approach Him; but in the spirit of love. We may cry to Him, not as a criminal to a judge, nor as a slave to a master, but as a child to a Father, whom he tenderly loves, and who feels for him a pure and holy affec- tion. The Apostle John says : ' I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father.' Who is a child so likely to know as his Father ? What is the first word he utters but 'My Father,' or 'My Mother?' To whom is he so likely to flee in the hour of danger ? On whom will he call so freely in distress ? He relies on him for care and protection. He expects that he will defend him and provide for him. Then, will not God, who stands in this endearing relation, in a much higher and holier degree, exemplify it and fulfill it more perfectly aud divinely ? He certainly will. Then let this give us boldness and courage, at all times, to ask, and the promise is that we shall receive. Draw nigh. Conn. Daniel Orcutt
