As each particle of gold... 'As each particle of gold possesses every one of the chemical properties of all the gold on earth, so does each human being possess all the elements and properties of humanity in aggregate. The same process thaOvould separate the dross from one ounce of gold, would also separate the dross from all the gold in existence.'' F. W. E.
